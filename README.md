# local_auth with device credential option

This is a fork of the [local_auth](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/local_auth)

There is an open [Pull Request](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/pull/2489) to merge into bases local_auth package.

Addresses issue: [#49703](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/49703)

## Device credentials

The original plugin only supports biometric authentication. This package add a method that allows for device credentials if biometric authentication is not available.

`localAuth.authenticate()` behaves the same as the original plugin's `localAuth.authenticateWithBiometrics()` but also allows device credentials (pin, pattern, passcode) to be use.

## Check if device supports

```dart
final LocalAuthentication auth = LocalAuthentication();

// API 23 and up with security features enabled for Android
// Any iOS device
bool isSupported = await auth.isDeviceSupported();
```

## Authenticate by any means

```dart
final LocalAuthentication auth = LocalAuthentication();

authenticated = await auth.authenticate(
    localizedReason: 'Let OS determine authentication method',
    useErrorDialogs: true,
    stickyAuth: true);
```

## Check biometrics

```dart
final LocalAuthentication auth = LocalAuthentication();

bool isBiometricsAvailable = await auth.canCheckBiometrics();
```

## Authenticate with only biometrics

```dart
final LocalAuthentication auth = LocalAuthentication();

authenticated = await auth.authenticateWithBiometrics(
    localizedReason: 'Biometrics only',
    useErrorDialogs: true,
    stickyAuth: true);
```
